The trio of gas columns, located inside 
the Milky Way's Eagle Nebula, are 
factories for creating stars. The pillars 
themselves are the product of a massive
nearby O-type star that sculpted the gas 
with its powerful winds. O-stars are the 
universe's largest, hottest stars and 
live short lives that wreak havoc on their
 environments.
