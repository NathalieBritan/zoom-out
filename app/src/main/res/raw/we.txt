The knowledge that the atoms that comprise 
life on earth - the atoms that make up the 
human body, are traceable to the crucibles 
that cooked light elements into heavy 
elements in their core under extreme temperatures 
and pressures. These stars- the high mass ones 
among them- went unstable in their later years- 
they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their 
enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of all 
the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These 
ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense,
collapse, form the next generation of solar systems- 
stars with orbiting planets. And those planets now 
have the ingredients for life itself. So that when 
I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes we 
are part of this universe, we are in this universe, 
but perhaps more important than both of those facts 
is that the universe is in us.(c)Neil deGrasse Tyson
