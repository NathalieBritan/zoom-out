While thinking about the basic concept of my project I was really stuck, but then as far as I'm astroaddicted
and I'm excited about everything connected with space,
I came up with the idea to create the app that shows all the beauty and majesty of the Universe itself.
First things first, the main goal of the application is to show that science and astrophysics as well
can be exciting and absorbing even as the way of passtime beyond the educational side.
From the optional side the app offers two actions: 
- to watch the whole zoom out music video;
- to experience zoom in/out travel with short information about some space 
objects.
The journey starts from the Earth gradually zooming out with informative stations at space objects on its
way to the borders of observal Universe. You can discover 8 new facts about the Universe and one more 
the 9th very reality, that is considered to be the most mind blowing and breathtaking thing about the Universe 
and life itself.
From the side of app's construction, it has 4 activities:
- splash screen during the loading necessary data for app functionality in its first run, and during the 
unpacking of the usable data in its every run;
- the main menu screen with two options;
- the screen to watch the whole music video;
- the screen with zoom in/out buttons.
To actually run the application for the first time, you'll need to have the Internet connection. Every next 
run you'll be able to zoom in/out without the Internet access, but still you'll need it to watch the whole music 
video.
