The Great Red Spot is the most noticeable 
feature on Jupiter's surface - a storm 
about 12,400 miles long and 7,500 miles 
wide, about two to three times larger than 
Earth. Winds at its oval edges can reach 
up to 425 mph (680 km/h). This giant storm 
was first recorded in 1831 but may have 
first been discovered in 1665.
