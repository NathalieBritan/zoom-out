Alpha Centauri is a special star - 
not only because it is the closest 
stellar system to the sun but also 
because it is one of the relatively 
few places in the Milky Way Galaxy 
that may offer terrestrial life 
conditions. If humanity looks for 
intelligent life elsewhere, then 
Alpha Centauri is an excellent candidate.
