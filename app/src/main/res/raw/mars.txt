In 1976, Viking I photographed a mesa 
on Mars that had the appearance of a 
human face. Many individuals and 
organizations interested in 
extraterrestrial life argued that 
intelligent beings created the "Face."
Though the Mars Global Surveyor 
(1997-2006) revealed that the "Face"
was likely an optical illusion, 
believers in the "Face" charged NASA
with stripping data from the new image 
before it was released to the public
